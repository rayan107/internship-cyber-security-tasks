1. Use Strong, Unique Passwords

Avoid using the same password across accounts. Use a password manager to help generate and store them securely.


2. Think Before You Click

Don’t open suspicious emails or click unknown links. Phishing attacks often look real—verify before acting.


3. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Adding an extra step to log in helps protect your accounts, even if your password is compromised.


4. Keep Software Up to Date

Always install updates for your devices, browsers, and apps. Updates patch security holes.


5. Be Cautious with Public Wi-Fi

Avoid accessing sensitive accounts on public networks. Use a VPN when needed.
