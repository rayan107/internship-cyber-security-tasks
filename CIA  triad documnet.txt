CIA TRIAD

The **CIA Triad** is a core cybersecurity model made 
up of three principles: **Confidentiality**, **Integrity**, 
and **Availability**. Confidentiality means keeping information 
private and accessible only to authorized people, like protecting 
your email with a password or encrypting financial records. 
Integrity ensures data remains accurate and unaltered, 
such as making sure a bank transfer of \$500 isnâ€™t 
changed to a different amount during processing. 
Availability means ensuring systems and information 
are accessible when needed, for example keeping 
an online banking app running through backups 
and redundant servers. 
Together, these principles work to keep information
 **secret, correct, and available** in any situation.
