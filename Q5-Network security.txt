Network security protects systems from unauthorized access and cyber threats. Key concepts include:

Firewalls: Act as barriers that filter network traffic based on rules, blocking malicious access and allowing trusted connections.

VPNs (Virtual Private Networks): Encrypt your internet traffic and hide your IP address, making online activity private and secure—especially on public Wi-Fi.

HTTPS: A secure version of HTTP that uses encryption (SSL/TLS) to protect data between your browser and websites, indicated by a padlock icon in your browser.

Port Scanning: Used to identify open ports and services on a device—commonly done with tools like Nmap for security auditing or vulnerability detection.

You can also use the ping command to test network connectivity and measure response time.

These tools and practices are fundamental for maintaining secure and reliable network communication.
