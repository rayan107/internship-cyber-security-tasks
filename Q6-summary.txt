Cybersecurity Project Summary


In this final stage of the cybersecurity project, all previously covered concepts and code examples
are compiled into a structured notebook or report. This includes documentation on the CIA Triad,
Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption, Digital Signatures, and Network Security Basics. Each
section contributes to a deeper understanding of how to secure data and systems in the digital
world. The project contains: - Explanations and real-life examples of the CIA Triad principles:
Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. - Python demonstrations of symmetric encryption using a
shared secret key. - Asymmetric encryption with key pair generation, encryption using the public
key, and decryption with the private key. - Digital signature implementation showing how to sign and
verify messages for authentication and integrity. - A network security guide including firewalls,
VPNs, HTTPS, and port scanning, with tools like Nmap. These components are connected through
the common goal of ensuring secure communication and data protection. The CIA Triad serves as
the theoretical foundation, while encryption techniques and digital signatures demonstrate practical
applications. Network security practices reinforce system-level defenses. Together, they form a
comprehensive understanding of cybersecurity essentials.
