A **digital signature** is a cryptographic technique that ensures 
the **integrity** and **authenticity** of digital messages by using 
a pair of public and private keys. The sender generates a unique hash 
(fingerprint) of the message and encrypts it with their private key 
to create the signature, which is then sent along with the message. 
The receiver, using the sender’s public key, decrypts the signature 
to retrieve the hash and compares it with a freshly computed hash of 
the received message. If both match, it proves that the message is 
authentic (sent by the claimed sender) and has not been altered (integrity). 
For example, if Alice sends Bob the message *“Transfer \$1000 to Bob”* 
along with a signature, Bob can verify it with Alice’s public key; a 
successful match confirms both Alice’s identity and the message’s trustworthiness.
